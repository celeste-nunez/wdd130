            <p>Hello! My name is Celeste Nunez and I am from Rigby, Idaho. I enjoy crochet and playing stardew valley. I wasealed to my awesome husband in the Idaho Falls Temple! We are now currently living in Rexburg while I finish my bachelors degree in computer science. We have one snooty cat named cocopuff who I crochet lovely hats for in my spare time. I love mornings when I have a steady routine, and I like to listen to classical music while I work. My favorite local attractions are Cress Creek Nature Trail and of course if you visit there you have to stop at White Sparrow for a pie on the way back! I love Idaho Drug down in Rigby, they have the most amazing icecream. If you're feeling like spending a day at the pool Heice Hotsprings isn't too far and has a waterslide as well as a large outdoor pool. My favorite part about where I live is my family, they aren't too far from Rexburg and I get to visit them every Saturday. I love my family very much, so it's nice to see them often. I hope to stay near them after I graduate, so I hope my parents retire somewhere warm. I love this scripture from Romans 8: For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. It is a beautiful statement that reminds me how loved each child of God is. That each of us are valuable in the sight of our Father in Heaven, and that no matter how the trials of the world change us his love will always persist and bring us towards salvation.

            <p>This is my cat cocopuff, she wasn't always mine. If you look closely you'll notice that she is a very pretty cat, fluffy with exotic markings. This is because she is a Ragdoll Cat, a fancy breed of big friendly cats. For 4 years Cocopuff was a mom! She had many litters of very pretty kittens before it was time for her to retire. That's where I come in, Cocopuff needed a home and I happened to want a cat. Now Cocopuff lives a lazy life with many toys, an endless food bowl, and a fountain of attention.  </p>
